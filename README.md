Arduino program created with PlatformIO for my sim racing setup. It handles 3 devices at once - one board to rule them all ;)

- Adapter for Logitech H-Shifter
- Custom Handbrake DIY
- Custom sequential shifter

Program uses [ArduinoJoystickLibrary](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary), so just ATmega32u4 boards are supported (tested only with Ardunio Leonardo for now by myself).

Easy to modify and extend.
It seems to work pretty nice.
